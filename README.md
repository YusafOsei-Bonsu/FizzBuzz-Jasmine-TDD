## Project Brief
This mini project concentrates on developing FizzBuzz using TDD via Jasmine.

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript
- Jasmine

## Blockers/Resolutions
- Initially, I couldn't comprehend Jasmine's test results, due to being presented by green/red dots. To resolve this, I installed and used the [jasmine-spec-reporter](https://github.com/bcaudan/jasmine-spec-reporter/tree/master/examples/node).
